    '''A command to fold at the current caret position or at a given point.

    Optional command arguments:

    - `prefetch`:   Should usually be `false`, except for the built-in menu items under the "Edit" main menu, which
                    pre-run a request and cache the response to dynamically show or hide the item.
    - `hidden`:     Can be used for a hidden menu item with the purpose to run a request and store the response.
    - `strict`:     Allows to configure the folding behavior; `true` means to fold only when the caret is contained
                    within the folded region (like ST built-in `fold` command), and `false` will fold a region even if
                    the caret is anywhere else on the starting line.
    - `point`:      Can be used instead of the caret position, measured as character offset in the document.
